          <h1>Understanding of Big Data fields</h1>
          <p>
            Before the course, I had a deeply misunderstanding about big data. I
            used to suppose that big data only refers to large sets of data and
            the only thing I heard about it was Hadoop.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the importance of big data doesn’t simply revolve around
            how much data we have. The value lies in how we use it. It is not
            only a term that describes large, hard-to-manage volumes of data –
            both structured and unstructured – that inundate businesses on a
            day-to-day basis, but also, big data can be analyzed for insights
            that improve decisions and give confidence for making strategic
            business moves.
          </p>
          <p>
            The IT industry, in an attempt to quantify what is and isn’t Big
            Data, has come up with what are known as the “V’s” of Big Data. The
            foundational three are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong> Volume:</strong> The amount of data is immense. According
              to sources each day 2.3 trillion gigabytes of new data is being
              created.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Velocity:</strong> The speed of data and processing
              (analysis of streaming data to produce near or real time results)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Variety:</strong>The different types of data, structured,
              as well as, unstructured.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Today, big data is important and efficient mainly because it is :
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Cost reduction. Big data technologies such as Hadoop and
              cloud-based analytics bring significant cost advantages when it
              comes to storing large amounts of data
            </li>
            <li>
              New products and services. With the ability to gauge customer
              needs and satisfaction through analytics comes the power to give
              customers what they want.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h1>Impressive issue in the course</h1>
          <p>
            Over this course period, the most impressive issue to me is the
            blockchain .
          </p>
          <p>
            I heard the word "blockchain" a lot these days but never got to know
            what it is. During this course, I got a more comprehensive
            understanding about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Blockchain </strong> is a peer-to-peer decentralized
            distributed ledger technology that makes the records of any digital
            asset transparent and unchangeable and works without involving any
            third-party intermediary. It is an emerging and revolutionary
            technology that is attracting a lot of public attention due to its
            capability to reduce risks and frauds in a scalable manner.
